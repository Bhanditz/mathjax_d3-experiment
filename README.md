# MathJax + D3 Experiment

A super-basic MathJax + D3 experiment to add automatic SVG-based visualization of arithmetic statements after they've been typeset by MathJax

Inspired by this sprint item from the Benetech 2016 CSUN math accessibility sprint: http://mathsprintcsun.herokuapp.com/posts/7wnA2R3MFvmcwnAYL/tactile-exploration-of-math-content

Uses D3 to extract the underlying MathML representation of the arithmetic generated by MathJax when it parses a statement and generate a simple visual representation.
